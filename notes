1. Dataset: I played around with 3DSC (3D superconductor data that comes from experiments conducted in the literature). Real lab experiments
    Jarvis dataset created from DFT calculations, but also incorporating BCS theory. However, it only captures BCS (conventional) superconductors rather than other types like cuprates, iron-based and fermions
    Given the diff in types of data, and the weighting towards one type of data, we don't want the Dinov3 to learn from only one type of data too much
2. Rendering: We are going with physics informed rendering which includes:
    - Valence electron encoding:
